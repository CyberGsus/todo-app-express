# todo-app

This is a fullstack starter project
I'm developing to get better at Nodejs & Vue.

Will also dockerize the app.

## Notes

- Installation of modules is per-se, backend is completely separated from frontend
- Backend just serves an API with a mongodb database at `/api/v1`, you can use other endpoints to make a static file server
